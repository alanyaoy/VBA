+.gitignore
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+How can I ignore a file that is already committed to the repo?
+Below are the steps on how to ignore this file (lets say the filename is config.py):
+ Add it to .gitignore:
+      $ echo "config.py" >> .gitignore
+ Now tell git to not track this file by removing it from the index:
+      $ git rm --cached config.py
+ Doing git status shows you that you have deleted the file. However, if you do ls you will still see the file is still present on your local filesytem.
+ Now, add .gitignore to index and commit:
+   $ git add .gitignore
+     $ git commit -m "Ignore config.py"
+Note: When other developers pull this commit, the file config.py will be deleted from their local filesystem.
